          a. A GM, Coach, or Booster WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO SWITCH ROLES TO A PLAYER AFTER THE ROSTER DEADLINE at 12:00 pm (NOON) (ET) on June 1, 2017, unless under the circumstances described in Rule III, 2, below.

The top ranked Fans will be eligible to receive a prize should the Fan’s Team win the Tournament, as described in detail and exclusively in the Fan Contest Rules.
  III. TEAM ROSTERS
      1. To be eligible to compete in the Tournament, a Team’s roster shall consist of at least seven (7) and not more than fifteen (15) Players by 12 pm (NOON) ET on June 1, 2017.
          a. A Team may add, but not subtract, Players after June 1, 2017 and up to the day of the Team’s first game, but only after Producer has received a $1,000 Player Registration Fee, as described immediately below in III, 2.
      2. Any Team seeking to add Player beyond the first nine (9) Players or add any Player after June 1, 2017 shall only be permitted to add the Player to the Team’s roster after a $1,000 Player Registration Fee has been received by the Producer.
          a. The $1,000 Player Registration Fee must be paid to Producer prior to the registration of Players ten (10) through fifteen (15). If a Team seeks to add a Player after playing a game in the Tournament, the Player Registration Fee shall increase by $1,000 per round and similarly must be received prior to the Player’s registration.
              i. Example A: Team A has nine (9) Players and wants to add two (2) Players before it plays a game in the Tournament. The Player Registration Fee is $1,000 per Player. Thus, Player Registration Fees totaling $2,000 ($1,000 per Player) must be received by Producer prior to the additional Players being permitted to play for Team A.
              ii. Example B: Team B has 9 Players and wants to add a Player for its first round game. The Player Registration Fee is $1,000. Team B then wins its first round game and wants to add an 11th Player for its second round game. The Player Registration Fee is $2,000. Team B then wins its second round game and wants to add a 12th Player for its third round game. The Player Registration Fee is $3,000. Team B wins its third round game and wants to add a 13th Player for its fourth round game. The Player Registration Fee is $4,000. Team B wins its fourth round game and wants to add a 14th Player for its fifth round game. The Player Registration Fee is $5,000. Team B wins its fifth round game and wants to add a 15th Player for the Championship Game. The Player Registration Fee is $6,000.
              iii. Example C: Team C has seven (7) Players on June 1, 2017. Team C wishes to add two (2) additional Players to its roster on June 4, to bring its total number of Players to nine (9). After sending in Player Registration Fees totaling $2,000 ($1,000 per Player), Team C will be permitted to add the additional two (2) Players to its roster.
  IV. CHARITY
      1. Donating to Charity. A Team may designate a Charity (as defined below) to which it will donate a percentage of its winnings, provided that such organization is tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (such non-profit organization, a “Charity”). In the scenario described in this paragraph, the Producer will not issue payment of any winnings directly to the Charity the Team has designated. The Team and its Participants will be solely responsible for any and all contributions, payments, or donations made to the designated Charity. PARTICIPANTS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION. THE PRODUCER IS NOT PROVIDING AND WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY TAX ADVICE TO TEAMS, PARTICIPANTS, OR THEIR ADVISORS.
      2. Charity-Sponsored Team. A Charity may apply to participate in the Tournament as a Team. In order to enter the Tournament, an individual representing the Charity would still have to be the GM, and would register the Team on the Website pursuant to these Rules. Any individuals who desire to play for the Charity Team will still have to register themselves pursuant to these Rules, and the GM will have to invite them to join the Team, as described herein. Notwithstanding any provision of these Rules, (i) a Charity Team is responsible for all obligations and requirements otherwise imposed on its Participants in these Rules, (ii) all Participants designated by a Charity shall participate solely as designees of the Charity Team and at its direction, and (iii) any rights or benefits, including any prize, award or other benefit, otherwise granted to Participants in these Rules shall instead belong solely to the Charity applicant. Should a Charity Team enter and win the Tournament, the Producer will make payment exclusively to the benefit of the Charity and will not split or provide any separate payment to any other Participant playing on behalf of the Charity.
          a. Fans of a Charity Team will still be eligible to receive prizes as described in the Fan Contest Rules.
  V. PARTICIPANT DISCLOSURES
  Any Participant who has been arrested, charged with or convicted of a violent felony, in each case that has resulted in any term of imprisonment or any form of incarceration within the last seven (7) years (i.e., since April 2010), or who is identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons Lists (the “SDN List”) issued by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (including if such identification first occurs during the Tournament) may, in Producer’s sole discretion, not be eligible to participate (or continue to participate) in the Tournament and, if so barred from participation, shall not be eligible to win any portion of any prize. Producer may also exclude from participation in the Tournament any individual who has been convicted of, or found liable for, any form of sexual offense, irrespective of whether a conviction led to imprisonment or any form of incarceration or has any other criminal history. Failure to disclose a history of criminal convictions, arrests or charges or identification on the SDN List may result in a Participant’s immediate disqualification from the Tournament and may also result in the disqualification of the Participant’s entire Team. A Participant with any history of such criminal convictions, arrests or charges specified above, or any knowledge that he or she is identified on the SDN List must notify Producer of such history or identification by sending an email to info@thetournament.com not later than 12:00 pm (NOON) (ET) on June 1, 2017. Such emails must include date of offense, location of offense, arrest and/or conviction, and disposition of the case, as applicable. If Participant has not provided Producer with any such information by such date/time, Producer shall assume that such Participant has represented that he or she has no criminal history and is not identified on the SDN List. In addition to the foregoing disclosure, Producer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to perform a formal background check in connection with any matters concerning Participant’s background, as well as check Participant against the SDN List, and Producer shall have the right to use such results to assess whether Participant may participate or continue to participate in the Tournament. Participant may be asked to provide all applicable information required of him/her in order for Producer to complete such formal background check and/or check of the SDN List, and Participant’s failure to do so may be grounds for disqualification from the Tournament.

      7.

Producer retains the right and authority to replace a disqualified team with another team (including for the championship game).
      9. Each Participant is prohibited from gambling and from associating with those who gamble in connection with the Tournament.

Upon discovery of a Participant's involvement or association with gambling in connection with the Tournament, Producer may notify all appropriate law enforcement authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, local police departments and all offices of prosecution who retain jurisdiction over the illegal activities.
      10. If at any time a Participant feels he or she is unable to participate in the Tournament for health or other reasons, Participant may elect to drop out and not continue his/her participation in the Tournament, so long as such Participant gives reasonable advance notice to his/her Team and the Producer.

A GM is not required to appear at a game, but he/she must communicate in writing to Producer (or its designee) that he/she will not be attending a game. If a Participant is injured during competition and is unable to continue playing, his or her Team will not be able to replace Participant, but if such Team goes on to win the Team Prize, the injured Participant (other than a Participant on a Charity Team) will have the right to share in such Team Prize, subject to any separate agreement among such Team’s Participants.

Additional information may also be required as part of such allocation process (e.g., social security numbers, completion of IRS Form W-9, etc.).
